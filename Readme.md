# Online Marketplace Shipping Schema Project
The schema discussed here was created as part of a major project aimed at developing from scratch software for some online marketplace (Iâ€™ll be referring to this particular online marketplace as just **OM**). 

The OM system includes a relational database (MySQL). Not only does it hold all the information about OM's customers and their orders as well as sellers and their products, but it is also meant to facilitate OM shipping operations. The following diagram features the DB's conceptual data model:
